# TabLock Chrome Extension for APEX: Feature list



## Tab-Locking
prevent accidental tab movement. It is simple to use – customise your tabs then lock them in place (using the padlock button in the Chrome Extension bar). Unlock to move them again and once happy then click to lock them in place.

## Focus Dialog Bypass
The Run Dialog is easily bypassed. However, the Focus Dialog needed a bit of creative thinking. You will need to activate this feature in the Tab-Lock options page; then say goodbye to the Focus Dialog page.

## Repositonal APEX 5.1-like Tabs for APEX 5.0
Such a great feature is the ability to reposition your page designer tabs in APEX 5.1; I thought why should the APEX 5.0 developers miss out? Therefore the same repositionable tab functionality (minus the ability to relocate tabs to different tab groups) is available – I even fixed the Gallery tab group not persisting bug (which is still present in later version of APEX)

## Contextual access to Page Item Names
Right-click within a Text item or Code Editor to reveal quick-picks of page item names & Substitution String which can be pasted directly in to your code

## APEX Shortcuts
Right Click the Chrome Extension button to access quick shortcuts links with API documentation links

## Case Rotation
Ctrl-Double-Click to rotate the case of text fields, with a special focus on labels containing the word ID

## Revealer Tab
Revealer Tab displays browser values associated with page items, IGs and Editable Interactive Grids. It also works within modal dialogs. Saves you typing apex.item('P1_NEW').getValue() in the console

## Extended Debug
Debugging at level 3 causes highlighting within the debugger for quick access to user defined debug messages

## Validate & Close for Code Editors
Clicking this button causes the Code Editor to compile and only close when the code validates. This saves you a few mouse-kilometers a day.

## Forced Themes
Using the option forces all code editors to use a specific additional them rather than pre-supplied ones. 

## APEX 5 style shortcuts for higher versions of APEX
You can once again use CTR+ALT+R and CTRL+ALT+S to Save&Run or Save your page in all newer version of APEX
